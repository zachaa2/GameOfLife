Game of Life Application
Author: Aaron Zachariah
Operating System: Windows 8.1
Tested using Java version 1.8.0_331

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
To start the application, you must run the "start" script. There will be two versions, one is a cmd script an one is a bash script.
Make sure to run the correct script for your Operating system.

Simply open the terminal, navigate to the scripts folder and run. Double-clicking the script
directly from the folder will also work. The application will open and run, by displaying the User Interface.
The simulation can be configured and run via the UI. Please see the User Manual for more information.

The repo contains an extra directory called "images" which I added to store a few basic image icons used on the UI.
There is also a bin folder, which contains all the class files that get run. It is also recommend storing any input files
in the bin directory, as it is the default directory for the File Chooser prompt.
